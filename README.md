- 👋 Hi, I’m @DukeSkywhopper. Obviously, that's not the name my parents gave me, but it's the one I will go by here. Remember that names aren't important here, what matters is the code.

- :star: The code you'll find here is intended to be of the highest quality that I can provide, given the skills I have as the code is written. Naturally, everyone improves over time, and newer code will likely be of a higher quality than older code, but I will review old code every six months in an effort to keep even old code as clean and up to date as possible.

- :collision: THIS CODE IS NOT UP FOR REVIEW. This code is not meant for anyone but me until it is released as a public work. Therefore, until you are a member of the public, viewing this code from affar, you are viewing this code privately, and perhaps very closely. You are more than welcome to any and all opinions, but until this code is published please refrain from sharing such opinions with me or anyone else.
